# Data Science and Machine Learning in Micro-Agriculture

This project explores the intersection of data science, machine learning, and agriculture, focusing on micro-agriculture applications. The research investigates how we can collect data from indoor plants and outdoor gardens, then utilize that data to automate the management of activities like plant watering schedules using artificial intelligence.

## Features

- Real-time sensor data collection and visualization
- Machine learning-based plant care automation
- Interactive data dashboards
- Comprehensive research documentation
- Responsive web interface

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- Styled Components
- MySQL
- Grafana
- IoT Sensors

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MySQL (for database functionality)
